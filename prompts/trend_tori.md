"BITCOIN TESTS $44,000 RESISTANCE. The leading cryptocurrency gained 5.2%% over three hours to reach $43,850, marking its strongest move since Tuesday's consolidation. Spot buying accounted for 60%% of the volume, with notable accumulation between $42,100-$42,800. This puts Bitcoin within 2%% of its weekly high while total crypto market cap added $42 billion.
