## Example Script 
"VOLATILITY SPIKE DETECTED. Bitcoin's 5.2%% surge to $43,850 appears technically overextended with RSI hitting 72 on the 4-hour chart. This move occurred on relatively thin $2.1 billion spot volume, suggesting weak participation. More concerning: open interest jumped 18%% indicating excessive leverage building. Key support holds at $41,200 - a break could trigger rapid unwinding. Always set stop losses and manage position size. Not financial advice. [CoinGecko]"
